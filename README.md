# ⚖️ Vow: Real-Time Organizational Memory & Alignment

**Vow** is an autonomous "Agreement Ref" that monitors real-time human discussions to detect, codify, and verify commitments as they happen. Built for high-stakes environments, it bridges the "Alignment Gap" by turning spoken words into structured, machine-readable organizational memory.

## 🚀 The Core Innovation: Real-Time Refereeing
Unlike traditional meeting assistants that provide post-hoc summaries, Vow acts as a live participant. It extracts decisions, action items, and financial commitments in near-zero latency, pushing **Confirmation Cards** to participants for instant ratification.

### **Key Technical Pillars**
* **Streaming Inference:** Utilizes a custom [WhisperLive](https://github.com/al-ameen36/WhisperLive) backend for sub-second, WebSocket-driven speech-to-text.
* **Dual-Model Residency:** Both **Llama 3.3 70B** and **Whisper** stay resident on the **AMD MI300X (192GB HBM3)**, eliminating model-swapping latency.
* **Structured Intelligence:** Every vow is codified into a strict JSON schema via vLLM-optimized kernels.
* **Contextual Diarization:** Maintains a stateful memory of speaker identity and evolving consensus.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Hardware:** AMD Instinct™ MI300X (AMD Developer Cloud)
* **Backend:** [WhisperLive](https://github.com/al-ameen36/WhisperLive) (Custom Fork), ROCm 6.x, FastAPI
* **Models:** Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, OpenAI-Whisper
* **Frontend:** TanStack Start (Real-time WebSocket UI)
